# Packages requiring flat compat for configs (@eslint/eslintrc's FlatCompat)

- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - Should have a new version that has a flat config soon.
- `eslint-plugin-import` - Currently does not have a flat config.

# Tasks

- Look through the non-configured and disabled rules and see which ones do we need to enable.
